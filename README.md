# Smart parking systems have emerged as a transformative solution to alleviate the
 perennial issue of parking space scarcity in urban areas. With the rapid urbanization
and the ever-growing number of vehicles on the road, finding a free parking spot has
become a daunting challenge for drivers, leading to congestion, frustration, and even
safety hazards. To address this pressing concern, innovative technologies such as
NodeMCU and IR sensors are being leveraged to develop smart parking solutions that
streamline the parking process and optimize space utilization .
